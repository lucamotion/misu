# misu

Misu (stylized as "misu") is a Discord bot that aims to provide many useful community-oriented functions for Discord servers. It was originally intended to be an alternative to [Miso](https://misobot.xyz/) with removed fluff and more useful features.

Misu is built on top of the [Kaltsit](https://github.com/lucamotion/kaltsit) framework, which I also maintain. It can be used as a reference to get a feel for how Kaltsit works.

## Features

### Custom role management

Let your server members create and customize their own personal roles without requiring staff intervention by using `/my roles`.

Existing roles can be bound to a user, turning them into custom roles, with `/bind`, or unbound with `/unbind`.

> [!NOTE]
> Newly-created roles are positioned below Misu's highest role position, so Misu's highest role should be above any server roles you'd like custom roles to override.
